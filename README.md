ThreatByte is a deliberately vulnerable web application designed to demonstrate some Web and API security risks. It serves as a learning platform for security professionals and developers to explore common vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

## üöÄ Features

The ThreatByte application aims to represent a simple online file-storing and sharing platform. It is developed in Python and uses the Flask framework. Currently it has the following features:

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
- **Dashboard:** Users have a personalized dashboard to view and manage their uploaded files.
- **File Upload:** Users can upload files to the application.
- **File Download:** Users can download files from the application.
- **Profile Management:** Users can view and edit their profile information.

- Insecure Configurations
- Weak or Improper Cryptographic Implementations
- Lack of Brute-Force Protection
- Weak Session Management
- Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
- Broken Object Property Level Authorization (BOPA)
- Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Path Traversal
- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
  - Reflected XSS
  - Stored XSS
  - DOM-based XSS
- Unrestricted File Upload

- SQLite

## üñ•Ô∏è Running ThreatByte Locally

```sh
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/anotherik/ThreatByte.git && cd ThreatByte

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv_threatbyte
source venv_threatbyte/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv_threatbyte\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies and setup database
pip install -r requirements.txt
python db/create_db_tables.py

# Run the application
